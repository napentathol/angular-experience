            <p>My name is Alex Webster. I currently work at GoHealth LLC as a software engineer. I am primarily a Java developer, however I have worked with javascript extensively for personal projects, and I maintain an angular single page application for GoHealth LLC. I am currently looking to move back to the Rochester area as a software engineer.</p>
            <p>Since I have worked more with java, I figured I would demonstrate my talent with javascript and angular to make a simple single page app.</p>
